// Install-time docs for the base `quill` item — the one item every consuming app
// installs. The shadcn CLI prints an item's `docs` field on `add`, so this is the
// single moment Quill can hand an app its theming contract. It shipped with no
// `docs` at all, which is why apps were never told that `--yes` does not update a
// changed file (only `--overwrite` does) and silently skips instead.
//
// Generated, never hand-written: the theme and accent lists come from
// src/tokens/themes.mjs and the token source, so a new theme or a changed default
// accent reaches installers without anyone remembering to edit prose. DESIGN.md's
// own Activation section had drifted out of date by one whole theme — that is the
// failure mode this avoids.

    `Charts — use the chart tokens (--chart-series-1..${chartSeriesCount()}, the sequential and diverging ramps), never raw pigments. Assign series colours in that fixed order and never reorder or cycle survivors when a filter drops one: the order keeps the palette distinguishable under all three dichromacies.`,

    `Wiring — the CLI install merges the theme into your Tailwind stylesheet. A theme FILE must be imported from inside that stylesheet — \`@import "./quill-theme.css"\` after \`@import "tailwindcss"\` and below any \`@custom-variant dark\` line shadcn wrote (the last wins) — never from layout.tsx, where every Quill utility is dead.`,

    `dark: utilities — stock primitives' dark: tweaks follow Quill's dark themes (and the .dark class) once the theme is wired; nothing to add by hand.`,

    `Self-check — after changing UI, run \`node scripts/quill-check.mjs\` (install once: \`npx shadcn@latest add @quill/check\`) and clear every finding: stock colours, raw colours, bracket values where a token exists, retired names, dead classes. An exception: \`// quill-check: allow <rule> — <why>\` on the line above.`,

    `Updating — re-run with --overwrite, not --yes: on a file you have changed, --yes prompts in a terminal and silently skips when non-interactive.`,
