/**
 * What every colour role is for — written once, rendered into DESIGN.md, llms.txt,
 * the agent-rules file apps install, and Storybook's Colors page.
 *
 * An agent choosing a colour reads names, and the names do not explain themselves:
 * seven surface roles are three colours (`card` = `popover` = `sidebar`; `secondary` =
 * `muted` = `accent`), `primary` is ink rather than a brand colour, and `accent` is the
 * pale highlight rather than the accent. Before this module the agent docs named 3 to
 * 12 of the 31 roles and said when to use none of them.
 *
 * Every line is grounded in how shipped code uses the role (842 class uses, measured
 * 2026-09-21; docs/drafts/2026-09-21-role-intents-draft.md holds the counts and
 * examples). `use` and `never` stay under 170 characters each: this text is installed
 * into apps and read by agents on every task.
 *
 * roles.test.mjs fails when a role ships without a line here, or a line names a role
 * that does not ship.
