// Theme + accent metadata. The single list of what themes exist.
//
// This lives here, not in scripts/build-tokens.mjs, because both sides need it:
// the build (node) generates CSS and the DTCG export from it, and the browser
// (Storybook's preview config, and any app UI that offers a theme picker) needs
// the same list to render a switcher. build-tokens.mjs imports node:fs, so it
// can never be pulled into a browser bundle — which is how five separate
// hand-typed copies of this list came to exist, and how the Intelligent theme
// stayed invisible in Storybook and both theme pickers for sixteen days.
//
// Nothing here may import anything with a node dependency. Keep it pure data.

// `label` is the short human name, used verbatim in UI (Storybook's toolbar, the
// theme-selector block). Prose that needs a qualifier — "(default)" — composes it
// from `colorScheme` / DEFAULT_MODE rather than baking it into the name.
